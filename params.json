It is encryption agnostic. \r\nYou can guard your data with any encryption algorithm you want. All you need\r\nis a simple class that does 3 things.\r\n\r\n1. Takes a hash argument for `initialize`\r\n2. Provides an `encrypt` method that returns the encrypted string\r\n3. Provides a `decrypt` method that returns the plaintext\r\n\r\nNote: Any options defined using `crypt_keeper` will be passed to `new` as a \r\nhash.\r\n\r\nUse can see an AES example here [here](https://github.com/jmazzi/crypt_keeper_providers/blob/master/lib/crypt_keeper_providers/aes.rb)\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nThe options available were either too complicated under the hood or had weird \r\nedge cases that made the library hard to use. I wanted to write something\r\nsimple that *just works*.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  crypt_keeper :field, :other_field, :encryptor => :aes, \r\n    :passphrase => 'super_good_password'\r\nend\r\n\r\nmodel = MyModel.new(field: 'sometext')\r\nmodel.save! #=> Your data is now encrypted\r\nmodel.field #=> 'sometext'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt works with all persistences methods: `update_attribute`, `update_attributes`, \r\n`create`, `save` etc.\r\n\r\n## Creating your own encryptor\r\n\r\nCreating your own encryptor is easy. All you have to do is create a class \r\nunder the `CryptKeeperProviders` namespace, like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmodule CryptKeeperProviders\r\n  class MyEncryptor\r\n    def initialize(options ={})\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def encrypt(value)\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def decrypt(value)\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust require your code and setup your model to use it. Just pass the class name\r\nas an underscored symbol\r\n\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  crypt_keeper :field, :other_field, :encryptor => :my_encryptor,\r\n    :passphrase => 'super_good_password'\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'crypt_keeper'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install crypt_keeper\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5. Create new Pull Request\r\n"}
